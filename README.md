# Cyb3rSchpunk3lizer

This Is Cyb3rSchpunk3lizer.

Imaginary neural blueprint for the the sensory blitzer machine.

## Hardware ##
-   Raspberry Pi 4 8gb
-   Capacitive touch board (Adafruit)
-   Screen TBD
-   Buttons, sensors, LEDs etc (Adafruit, Amzn)
-   Tesla Coil BT Speaker
-   Plasma Ball
-   Case TBD (DIY plastic box initially)
-   Ferrofluid audio visualizer (Amzn)



## Requirement list ##
- **Synthesizer** (4x4 keys, 2-4 knobs for effect comntrol, multiple synth effects) 
  - Capacitive synth keys (Fruits, plastic dog poo, other yummy capacitive objects etc)
  - Effect knobs (For Pitch, Tempo, Reverb and other effects for a spacey, retro, ambient sound)
  - Accelerometer (For changing sound parameter, eg pitch)
- **Music Player**
  - Sound Effects (Real time knob adjustment of Pitch, tempo, voice changer for eg Spotify or Youtube audio)
- **Touch screen** (3-7" touchscreen?)
  - Audio Visualizer (Oscilloscope effect)
- **Tesla coil BT speaker** (BT connected. Ability to play either local files or the synth output)
- **BT speaker** (For best audio output quality)
- **Ferrofluid Audio Visualizer** (Hardware currently off-the-shelf, needs surgery to incorporate)
